## Completed ETL Project Page: [NBA Finals](https://alexmartinez1745.github.io/ETL-Project/)

Each year as we sit from our couches and watch amateur college athletes, or in special cases, high schoolers become pro basketball athletes in the NBA Draft. The question of whether or not these young men are going to rise to the occasion, make it to the NBA Finals and win. Also, if they don't make it the first year, how many years did it take them until they did reach that final level of NBA success?

So, our team decided to investigate from the starting point of a playerâ€™s career to the end point of making it to the finals or the lack of making it to the finals in a 10-year span. We looked at the team rosters from the following years of 2005-2015 using csv files we obtained from Data World, Basketball-Reference.com, and Kaggle. In this ten-year span we were able to see whether or not players had been able to make it to the finals and win the title of NBA Champions.

Once we got the source material, we created a sql database, dataframe and a ERD we able to determine the success of a player in the NBA Finals based on what number he was in the NBA Draft. And if the player having enough early draft players on his team could definitely increase their odds of winning. We also looked at the positions that each player played during the finals (point guard, forward, etc.) and whether or not their draft pick position played a factor in their success in the finals. This displayed on our ETL site, on the Distribution Link.
